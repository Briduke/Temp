									<p>
										Mobile apps are leading the market with improved branding, customization, and user interaction. Since its inception, it has been disrupting the entire way internet services have been accessed by people.
										 In particular, e-commerce has found its fertile ground once it moved into an app-centric strategy. Over half of the internet traffic is coming from mobile devices, and most of them are from mobile apps.
									</p>
									<p>
										Statistics show that 79% of smartphone users bought online via their mobile devices. In 2019, a whopping 2.3 trillion dollars in mobile commerce is expected globally.
										The new studies might have gone beyond these inferences. And all these estimations are pointing to the advantages of mobile apps over other digital channels.
									</p>
									<p>
										 Let’s check what are the advantages.

											<h3>Faster Operation:</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Mobile applications are way faster than mobile websites. Even a well-groomed and optimised responsive mobile website cannot match the speed of an app. Businesses are all about giving service as fast as possible today. A slight lag can cause a massive loss, and that leads to customer discontent.
										</p>
										<p>
											The functional benefit that apps have is the ability to store data locally and retrieve the relevant dataset instantly. Unlike apps, mobile websites need to fetch the data far from the servers, and the latency time lags their performance. In addition, the sophisticated code frameworks used for mobile app development are faster than the scripts used for mobile website development. Thus, all of these features constitute mobile apps to gain an advantage over mobile websites.

										<p>
											Mobile apps provide customer-appropriate content and a personalised experience.
